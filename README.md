# Metro Optimization Software

This project is hosted on Streamlit at [metromap.streamlit.app](https://metromap.streamlit.app).

## Overview
The **Metro Optimization Software** is designed to simulate, analyze, and optimize subway systems. By leveraging advanced graph theory and machine learning techniques, the software evaluates subway layouts for efficiency in passenger flow and congestion management. 

This project combines concepts from applied mathematics, optimal control, and graph neural networks (GNNs) to develop scalable solutions for urban transit challenges.

## Key Features

- **Graph Representation of Subway Maps**: Models subway systems as graphs using NetworkX, focusing on node classes and graph structure.
- **Passenger Flow Simulation**: Simulates passenger transport to assess congestion and flow.
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Integration**: Approximates efficiency scores to bypass computationally expensive simulations.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Identifies optimal layouts to minimize congestion and maximize efficiency.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Enhance GNN pipeline
- [ ] Add support for real-world metro areas
- [ ] Expand visualizations with heatmaps and flow animations
